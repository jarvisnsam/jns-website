## STYLING STATUS

âœ… **Subtitle gradient updated:** Changed font-weight from 700 to 900 to make the gradient more vibrant and match the header "JARVIS AND SAM" gradient

The gradient colors are already the same as the header:
- **Header gradient:** `linear-gradient(90deg, #00BFFF, #FF3333)`
- **Subtitle gradient:** `linear-gradient(90deg, #00BFFF, #FF3333)`

The increased font-weight (900) now makes the subtitles appear bolder and more vibrant, matching the header's visual impact.
